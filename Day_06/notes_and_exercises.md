# Day 06: Advanced Linux Commands

## Learning Objectives
By the end of Day 6, you will:
- Master advanced text processing with grep, awk, and sed, including common flags and regex patterns
- Use find and xargs for file operations with criteria like size, type, and user
- Combine commands with pipes, redirection, and xargs for powerful one-liners
- Process and manipulate text data efficiently, including counting, sorting, and transforming
- Apply these tools in real DevOps scenarios like log analysis and automation

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

## Sample Dataset: sample.log

We'll use the following log file, `sample.log`, for all command examples and exercises:

```

## Notes

- **Why Learn Advanced Linux Commands?**
  - These commands are essential for text processing, automation, and efficient system administration in high-volume environments like logs and configs.
  - Mastery of these tools is expected in DevOps, SRE, and system engineering interviews, where you'll debug issues or automate workflows on the fly.

## Top 6 Log Parsing Commands

| Command | Simple Description | Examples |
|---------|--------------------|----------|
| **GREP**<br>`$ grep <pattern> file.log` | Finds lines in a file that contain a specific word or pattern. | 1. Find file names that match: `grep -l "linuxthefinalboss" *.log`<br>2. Case insensitive word match: `grep -i "linuxthefinalboss" test.log`<br>3. Show line numbers: `grep -n "linuxthefinalboss" test.log`<br>4. Invert matches: `grep -v "linuxthefinalboss" test.log`<br>5. Take patterns from a file: `grep -f pattern.txt test.log`<br>6. Search recursively in a dir: `grep -R "linuxthefinalboss" /home` |
| **CUT**<br>`$ cut -d' ' -f3 file.log` | Extracts specific parts (like columns or characters) from each line of a file. | 1. Cut first 3 bytes: `cut -b1-3 file.log`<br>2. Select 2nd column delimited by a space: `cut -d' ' -f2 test.log`<br>3. Specify character position: `cut -c1-8 test.log` |
| **SED**<br>`$ sed /<regex>/<replace>/g` | Edits text files by replacing, deleting, or inserting parts based on patterns. | 1. Substitute a string: `sed s/linuxthefinalboss/go/g test.log`<br>2. Replace the 2nd occurrence: `sed s/linuxthefinalboss/go/2 test.log`<br>3. Replace case insensitive: `sed /linuxthefinalboss/go/I test.log`<br>4. Replace string on line range of 2-4: `sed '2,4s/linuxthefinalboss/go/' test.log`<br>5. Delete a line: `sed '4d' test.log` |
| **AWK**<br>`$ awk '{print $4}' test.log` | Processes text files by scanning for patterns and handling columns (fields). | 1. Print matched lines: `awk /linuxthefinalboss/ {print} test.log`<br>2. Split a line into fields: `awk '{print $1 $3}' test.log`<br>3. Print lines 2 to 7: `awk 'NR>=2 && NR<=7 {print NR, $0}' test.log`<br>4. Print lines with more than 10 characters: `awk 'length($0)>10' test.log`<br>5. Find a string (field=4) = "linux" print line: `awk '$4=="linux" {print $0}' test.log` |
| **SORT**<br>`$ sort test.log` | Arranges the lines in a file in order (like alphabetical or numerical). | 1. Output to a file: `sort -o output.txt input.txt`<br>2. Sort in reverse order: `sort -r test.log`<br>3. Sort numerically: `sort -n test.log`<br>4. Sort based on the 3rd column: `sort -k3n test.log`<br>5. Check if a file is ordered: `sort -c test.log`<br>6. Sort and remove duplicates: `sort -u test.log` |
| **UNIQ**<br>`$ uniq test.log` | Removes or counts duplicate lines (works best on sorted files). | 1. Tell how many times a line repeats: `uniq -c test.log`<br>2. Print repeated lines: `uniq -d test.log`<br>3. Print unique lines: `uniq -u test.log`<br>4. Skip the first two fields: `uniq -f 2 test.log`<br>5. Compare case-insensitive: `uniq -i test.log`

### grep (Global Regular Expression Print)
**grep** searches for patterns (strings or regex) in files, outputting matching lines. Use it for log filtering, error hunting, or auditing. Supports basic/extended regex (-E) and fixed strings (-F).

```bash
# Search for ERROR log entries
grep 'ERROR' sample.log

# Case insensitive search for "login"
grep -i 'login' sample.log

# Get all lines for user1
grep 'user1' sample.log

# Show line numbers for WARN
grep -n 'WARN' sample.log

# Count matching lines
grep -c 'INFO' sample.log

# Invert match: Show non-ERROR lines
grep -v 'ERROR' sample.log

# Recursive search in directory
grep -r 'ERROR' /var/log/

# List files with matches (no content)
grep -l 'Disk space low' *.log

# Extended regex: Match IPs (basic example)
grep -E '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' sample.log
```

---

### awk
**awk** processes text by records (lines) and fields (space-separated by default). Use patterns/actions for filtering, math, and formatting. FS (field separator) and OFS (output separator) are customizable.

```bash
# Print the username and IP address columns
awk '{print $4, $5}' sample.log

# Print only ERROR log lines' usernames
awk '$3 == "ERROR" {print $4}' sample.log

# Count number of lines per log level
awk '{count[$3]++} END {for (level in count) print level, count[level]}' sample.log

# Sum timestamps (assuming numeric) for INFO lines
awk '$3 == "INFO" {sum += $2} END {print "Total INFO seconds:", sum}' sample.log

# Change field separator to tab for output
awk -F' ' 'OFS="\t" {print $4, $5}' sample.log

# BEGIN/END blocks: Header and total count
awk 'BEGIN {print "Log Analysis"} {print $0; total++} END {print "Total lines:", total}' sample.log

# Match pattern: Lines with IP starting with 192
awk '/^192/ {print $4}' sample.log
```

---

### sed (Stream Editor)
**sed** edits streams/files non-interactively: substitute, delete, insert, or transform. Use -i for in-place edits (with backup via -i.bak). Chain commands with -e.

```bash
# Replace "user1" with "admin"
sed 's/user1/admin/g' sample.log

# Delete all INFO lines
sed '/INFO/d' sample.log

# Print lines 2 to 5
sed -n '2,5p' sample.log

# In-place replace (backup to .bak)
sed -i.bak 's/user1/admin/g' sample.log

# Multiple edits: Replace user1 and add prefix to ERROR
sed -e 's/user1/admin/g' -e 's/^ERROR/ALERT: ERROR/g' sample.log

# Insert line before matching pattern
sed '/ERROR/i\--- SECURITY ALERT ---' sample.log

# Global substitute with regex: Change all IPs starting with 10 to 192
sed 's/10\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+/192.168.0.X/g' sample.log
```

---

### find & xargs
**find** locates files/directories by criteria (name, type, size, time, permissions). **xargs** reads stdin to build/execute commands, handling args safely (e.g., -0 for null-separated input).

Assume you have several log files in your current directory (sample.log, app.log, system.log):

```bash
# Find all .log files in current directory
find . -name '*.log'

# Search for "ERROR" in all .log files
find . -name '*.log' -exec grep 'ERROR' {} +

# Remove all .log files containing "Disk space low"
grep -l 'Disk space low' *.log | xargs rm

# Find files larger than 1MB
find . -name '*.log' -size +1M

# Find files owned by user 'root', modified in last 7 days
find /var/log -user root -mtime -7

# Use xargs with placeholder for complex args
find . -name '*.log' | xargs -I {} grep -c 'ERROR' {}

# xargs with null delimiter (safer for filenames with spaces)
ls *.log | xargs -0 rm

# Combine: Grep in found files, then count total matches
find . -name '*.log' -exec grep -l 'ERROR' {} + | xargs wc -l
```

---

### cut, sort, uniq, tr
- **cut** extracts sections: -d for delimiter, -f for fields, -c for characters.
- **sort** orders: -n numeric, -r reverse, -k key field, -u unique.
- **uniq** deduplicates: -c count, -i ignore case, -d duplicates only.
- **tr** transforms: -d delete, -s squeeze repeats, -c complement set.

These are essential for extracting and cleaning up data.

```bash
# Extract only IP addresses (column 5)
cut -d' ' -f5 sample.log

# Show unique usernames
awk '{print $4}' sample.log | sort | uniq

# Count unique IP addresses
awk '{print $5}' sample.log | sort | uniq | wc -l

# Convert usernames and log levels to uppercase
awk '{print $3, $4}' sample.log | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

# cut characters: First 10 chars per line
cut -c1-10 sample.log

# sort numeric by timestamp (column 2)
cut -d' ' -f2 sample.log | sort -n

# uniq with count and ignore case
echo -e "User\nuser\nUser" | sort | uniq -i -c

# tr delete newlines and squeeze spaces
tr -d '\n' < sample.log | tr -s ' '
```

## Extract IP Addresses

Extracting IP addresses from log files is a common task, whether working with web server logs or application logs. This can be done with awk (field extraction) or grep (regex matching).

### Example 1: Web server logs (access.log)

```bash
# Sample log entries (web server format)
echo "172.16.0.2 - - [01/Oct/2025:19:10:00 +0530] \"GET /about HTTP/1.1\" 200 2048" >> access.log
echo "203.0.113.25 - - [01/Oct/2025:19:15:00 +0530] \"POST /submit HTTP/1.1\" 404 256" >> access.log

# Method 1: Using grep with regex pattern to extract IP addresses
grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' access.log

# Method 2: Using awk to extract the first field (IP address)
awk '/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/ {print $1}' access.log

# Count unique IPs
grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' access.log | sort | uniq -c
```

### Example 2: Course sample logs (sample.log)

We'll use the provided sample.log (see top of these notes) for all course command demos.

```bash
# Extract IP addresses (column 5) using awk
awk '{print $5}' sample.log

# Extract IP addresses with grep regex (matches any IP-like pattern)
grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' sample.log

# Extract only unique IP addresses
awk '{print $5}' sample.log | sort | uniq

# Filter IPs starting with 192 using cut and grep
cut -d' ' -f5 sample.log | grep '^192'
```

## Best Practices
- Test commands on sample data first to avoid data loss
- Use `--help` or `man` pages (e.g., `man grep`) to explore options quickly
- Combine simple commands for complex tasks—pipes are your friend for readability
- Use `-i` flags carefully (they modify files in place); always specify backups
- Quote patterns to handle spaces/special chars: `grep "pattern with space"`
- For large files, consider `grep -F` for literals and `awk` for computations to optimize
- Always backup important files before bulk operations like find/xargs rm
