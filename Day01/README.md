# Day 01: What is Linux? (Kernel, Distributions & Ecosystem)

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Day 1, you should:
- Know what Linux is and where it came from  
- Understand the **Linux kernel** and what it does  
- Learn what **Linux distributions** (distros) are and when to use them  
- Get a picture of the **Linux ecosystem** and open-source world  
- See why Linux is important for **DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Engineers**  
- Understand the basics of **package managers** (installing/updating software)  

**Time needed:** 1–2 hours  

---

## 🌍 Why Learn Linux?
Linux is **everywhere**:
- Servers running the internet  
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Supercomputers  
- Android phones  
- IoT devices  

For DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Engineers:
- Most tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins) are **built for Linux**  
- Cloud VMs usually run on Linux  
- Linux helps with automation, scaling, and high uptime  

👉 Fact: More than **96% of top servers** and **all top supercomputers** use Linux.

## 🐧 What is Linux?
- Linux = **kernel** (the brain of the OS) created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  
- A **distribution (distro)** = Linux kernel + tools + apps (like Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, etc.).  
- Used for servers, desktops, embedded systems, mobiles, and more.  

💡 **Analogy:** Kernel = car’s engine. Distribution = complete car (engine + body + wheels).  

---

## 📜 Short History of Linux
- **1983:** GNU Project started by Richard Stallman  
- **1991:** Linus Torvalds released first Linux kernel  
- **1993:** Debian project began  
- **2000s:** Linux became popular in servers and embedded systems  
- **2010s:** Powering Android, cloud, and containers  
- **Today:** Runs most of the internet and cloud workloads

## ⚙️ Core Components of Linux

### Main Parts:
- **Kernel:** Manages CPU, memory, processes, files, networking  
- **Shell:** Command-line tool (bash, zsh, etc.)  
- **Utilities:** Basic commands (`ls`, `cat`, `systemctl`)  
- **User Apps:** Extra software (web servers, Docker, etc.)

## 🖥️ Linux vs Windows (Quick Compare)

| Feature | Linux | Windows | Why it matters |
|---------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Source | Open source | Closed | Open = free & flexible |
| Cost | Free | Paid | Saves $$ in cloud |
| File System | `/` root structure | C:, D: drives | Easier automation |
| Case Sensitive | Yes | No | Prevents confusion in scripts |
| Stability | Very stable (years uptime) | Needs reboots | Critical for production |
| Package Mgmt | apt, yum, dnf | .exe, .msi | Faster installs/updates |

---

## 📦 Linux Distributions (Distros)
A distro = Linux kernel + GNU tools + package manager + apps.  

Popular ones:
- **Ubuntu, Mint** → Beginner-friendly  
- **RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu Server** → Enterprise & cloud  
- **Alpine Linux** → Lightweight (great for Docker containers)  
- **Kali Linux** → Security testing  

---

## 🌐 Linux Ecosystem
- **GNU Tools** → basic utilities (bash, ls, gcc)  
- **Package Managers** → install/update software  
- **Container Tools** → Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Cloud** → Linux is default OS in AWS, GCP, Azure  

### Example Package Managers
| Distro | Package Manager | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Ubuntu/Debian | `apt` | `sudo apt install nginx` |
| RHEL/CentOS/Fedora | `yum`/`dnf` | `sudo dnf install nginx` |
| Arch Linux | `pacman` | `sudo pacman -S nginx` |

# How `ls` Command Works in Linux

This file explains what happens when we type the `ls` command in Linux.

---

## Steps

1. **You type `ls`**
   - The shell (like `bash`) receives your command.

2. **Shell finds the command**
   - Checks if `ls` is built-in (it’s not).
   - Looks in `$PATH` directories.
   - Finds the program at `/bin/ls`.

3. **Kernel runs the program**
   - Loads `/bin/ls` into memory.
   - Creates a new process.
   - Connects input/output to the terminal.

4. **`ls` executes**
   - Reads directory contents using system calls:
     - `opendir()`
     - `readdir()`
     - `stat()`

5. **Result shown**
   - Output goes to `stdout` (your terminal).

6. **Process ends**
   - `ls` exits with code `0`.
   - Shell shows a new prompt.

# 🤔 Interview Questions with Answers (Day 01)

### 1. What is the difference between the Linux kernel and a Linux distribution?  
- **Kernel**: The core part of Linux, which talks to hardware and manages CPU, memory, and devices.  
- **Distribution**: A complete package (kernel + tools + package manager + apps) like Ubuntu, CentOS, Amazon Linux.  

---

### 2. Explain kernel space vs user space.  
- **Kernel space**: Where the kernel runs, managing hardware and system resources.  
- **User space**: Where user programs (like browsers, editors, etc.) run.  
- Programs in user space use **system calls** to talk to the kernel.  

---

### 3. Name 3 Linux distros and their cloud use cases.  
- **Ubuntu** → Popular for cloud servers and DevOps.  
- **Amazon Linux** → Used in AWS for EC2 instances.  
- **CentOS/RHEL** → Used in enterprise servers.  

---

### 4. How do package managers (apt/yum) work? Why important for DevOps?  
- **Package managers** help install, update, or remove software easily.  
- They also handle dependencies automatically.  
- Important in DevOps because we need to quickly set up and update servers.  

---

### 5. What is the role of the GNU Project?  
- The **GNU Project** provides many tools and utilities (like compilers, libraries, shell) that make Linux usable.  
- Without GNU, Linux would just be the kernel.  

---

### 6. Why is Linux preferred over Windows for servers?  
- It is free and open-source.  
- More stable and secure.  
- Uses fewer resources.  
- Better for automation and scripting.  

---

### 7. How to check kernel version? Why do cloud providers use older kernels?  
- Run:  
  ```bash
  uname -r
```
